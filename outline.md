# WebXR

## Intro

Deliver VR / AR experiences via HTTP using web technologies (WebGL, canvas).
- Replaces WebVR, which was the original.
- Already supported in many modern browsers.

Support multiple clients and input models
- VR headset with stereoscopic display, degrees of movement, hand tracking, etc
- Mobile device with gyroscope
- Browser with cursor / keyboard
- NeuraLink HUD ðŸ˜‰

Here be dragons:
- Still highly experimental
- Performance is a bottleneck
- You're probably not badass enough to write pure WebGL

## Frameworks

A-Frame (Mozilla)
- "Custom HTML elements for VR"
- Declarative blocks that abstract three.js objects

Babylon.js, PlayCanvas
- Open source game engines with XR support

Others
- React 360. More focused on creating VR UIs.
- AWS Sumerian. Integration with rest of AWS ecosystem.
- Unity. The big leagues.

Physics

Camera
Interactions

Render Loop
etc.
...

Put it all together? And you get a sweet, immersive experience.
