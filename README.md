# Build VR experiences with WebXR

_Sunday August 23, 2020 [@Mozilla TW](https://moztw.org/space/)_

Have you ever thought about building your own virtual reality game or
simulation?

This event's goal is to overview the latest in WebXR. Put simply, WebXR allows
you to serve virtual (and augmented) reality content directly through the web
browser!

Note: This is a hands-on event, not a lecture. We'll work independently and in
small groups to build our own VR demos.

Required:

- A basic understanding of HTML and JS
- A laptop
- A smartphone (we'll provide Google Cardboards for testing)

The goal is for every attendee to deploy a VR experience before they leave!

Space will be limited to 35 RSVPs.
